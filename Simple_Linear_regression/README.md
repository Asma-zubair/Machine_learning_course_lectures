# 📈 Simple Linear Regression

This lecture introduces **Simple Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms used to model the relationship between **one input feature (X)** and **one output variable (Y)**.

## 📌 What You Will Learn

- What is Simple Linear Regression
- Relationship between independent and dependent variables
- Mathematical equation of linear regression
- Role of weights (slope) and bias (intercept)
- Prediction using a linear equation
- Loss function (Mean Squared Error)
- Basic understanding of gradient descent (conceptual)

---

## 🧠 Theory Overview

Simple Linear Regression follows the equation:

\[
y = wx + b
\]

Where:
- **x** → input feature  
- **y** → predicted output  
- **w** → weight (slope)  
- **b** → bias (intercept)

The goal is to find the best values of **w** and **b** that minimize prediction error.
