## 🧠 Theory Overview

Multiple Linear Regression follows the equation:

\[
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + ... + b
\]

Where:
- **x₁, x₂, x₃** → input features  
- **w₁, w₂, w₃** → corresponding weights  
- **b** → bias term  
- **y** → predicted output  

Each feature contributes to the final prediction.
